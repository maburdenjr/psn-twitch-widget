## Front-End Engineering Technical Assessment

* Write a simple web app that hits the Twitch API URL shown at the top (there are API docs online)
* Build the URL based on the query entered by the user in the search box shown in the mock
* Build out the list as shown in the mock.
* All UI elements are mandatory and self-explanatory
* Feel free to add more/better UI, as long as you include the mandatory elements
* No frameworks like jQuery/AngularJS.  Just vanilla JS with XHR to hit the API.
